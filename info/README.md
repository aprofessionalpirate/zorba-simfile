# ZORBA

## Warning: Flash
This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
ZORBA originally comes from an idea Rilla and I had while walking through the Piazza San Marco in Venice. It was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. It uses sound effects I made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and the music was thieved from a MIDI file that floats around the internet. I usedÂ [Aria Maestosa](http://ariamaestosa.sourceforge.net/) extensively in working with the MIDI. The font in ZORBA is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by[Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/).

~~You can read [my writing about the game](http://www.pippinbarr.com/tag/zorba?order=asc) on my blog.~~ ZORBA was discussed (in German) on [Superlevel](http://www.superlevel.de/spiele/zorba) and (in English) on [gamescenes](http://www.gamescenes.org/2011/11/art-game-pippin-barrs-zorba-2011.html). And [some crazy people made a guy play it while on a swing](http://a.yfrog.com/img256/4687/ehm.mp4), so there you go.
